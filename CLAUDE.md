# draw-for-llm

A tool for quickly sketching application UI mockups and sharing them with LLMs and other people.

## Documentation index

All documents are managed as pairs of Japanese (`*.ja.md`) and English (`*.en.md`) files.
Only the README is different: the English one is `README.md` and the Japanese one is `README.ja.md`.

- Always update both the Japanese and English versions in the same PR. Keep the heading structure aligned.
- When you add, remove, or rename a document, also update the index in this file and the links in the README.
- Do not write feature ideas or improvements in the documents. Manage them as GitHub Issues.
- Keep the README for users only. Write developer details in `docs/` and link to them from the README.
- Do not describe unimplemented features as if they were implemented. Check the code and configuration, and write only facts.
- In Japanese documents, start a new line after each full stop (`。`).

## Development

- Use pnpm as the only package manager. Do not create `package-lock.json`.
- See `docs/setup/` for details.
