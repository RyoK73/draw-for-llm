# Overview

## Tech stack

| Area       | Technology                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Framework  | Next.js (App Router), React |
| Drawing    | fabric.js                   |
| Backend    | Supabase (Postgres, Auth)   |
| Validation | zod                         |
| Styling    | Tailwind CSS                |
| Test       | vitest, Testing Library     |

Exact versions are in `package.json`.
Only fabric.js is pinned to an exact version, without `^`.
On saving, the version at that time is recorded in the DB as `fabric_version`.

## Directory structure

The codebase is split by what it does (vertical).
See [Directory structure](../rules/directory-structure.en.md) for the rule.

| Directory            | Role                                                                          |

## Drawing (`src/sketch-detail/draw/`)

| File                 | Role                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useFabricCanvas.ts` | Creates a fabric canvas, loads `canvasJson` and disposes it on unmount    |
| `useShapes.ts`       | Adds a rect, circle or triangle to the center of the canvas               |
| `useHistory.ts`      | Keeps `past` / `present` / `future` and provides `set`, `undo` and `redo` |

Details of `useFabricCanvas`:

- `loadFromJSON` receives the `signal` of an `AbortController`, and it is aborted on unmount.
- When the loading finishes, `isLoaded` becomes `true`.
  When the loading fails, `isLoaded` stays `false` and the error is set in `loadError`.
- `loadFromJSON` clears the background color of the canvas, so after loading it sets `backgroundColor` again only when the JSON has no `background`.
- fabric wraps the canvas element in its own wrapper.
  So the parent element of the canvas element is an element managed by React (such as a `div`).

## Sketch list (`src/sketch-list/`)

| File              | Role                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sketch-list.tsx` | Server Component. Renders the list from `getSketchList` |
| `index.ts`        | Exports `SketchList`                                    |

## Date and time (`src/design-system/local-time.tsx`)

`LocalTime` is a Client Component.
It shows `updated_at` in a `<time dateTime>` element.

`LocalTime` renders differently depending on where it runs.
It uses `useSyncExternalStore` to avoid a hydration mismatch.

| Where                        | Locale         | Time zone         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Server side and on hydration | `en-US`        | UTC               |
| Client                       | Browser locale | Browser time zone |

## Creating a sketch (`src/new-sketch/`)

| File                    | Role                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start-new-sketch.ts`   | Server Action. Signs in anonymously if needed, creates an empty sketch and goes to `/sketches/{id}` |
| `new-sketch-button.tsx` | Client Component. Calls `startNewSketch` and shows a toast on failure                               |
| `index.ts`              | Exports `NewSketchButton` and `startNewSketch`                                                      |

## Landing page (`src/landing-page/`)

| File               | Role                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `landing-page.tsx` | Server Component. Gets the auth state and renders the buttons for it  |
| `introduction.tsx` | Server Component. Renders the application's static introductory text. |
| `index.ts`         | Exports `LandingPage`                                                 |

## Sign-in and guest registration (`src/auth-form/`)

| File            | Role                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `auth-page.tsx` | Server Component. Gets the auth state and passes whether it is a guest to `AuthForm` |
| `auth-form.tsx` | Client Component. Handles entering the email and the code, resending and navigation  |
| `auth-error.ts` | Converts Supabase error codes into messages to show                                  |
| `index.ts`      | Exports `AuthPage`                                                                   |

See [Authentication](./auth.en.md) for details.

## Sketch page (`src/sketch-detail/`)

| File                | Role                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sketch-detail.tsx` | Server Component. Renders the info of one sketch got by `getSketch` and passes it to `SketchCanvas` |
| `sketch-canvas.tsx` | Client Component. Handles the canvas, the buttons to add shapes and auto-save                       |
| `draw/`             | Hooks for the fabric canvas (see the section above)                                                 |
| `save/`             | Hooks and functions for saving to the DB (see [Saving sketches](./save.en.md))                      |
| `index.ts`          | Exports only `SketchDetail`                                                                         |

Details of `SketchCanvas`:

- It draws the canvas at actual size (`width` × `height`) and the parent element scrolls.
- The buttons to add shapes are disabled until `isSketchLoaded` becomes `true`.
- When saving fails, it shows a fixed message as a toast with a fixed `id`.
  A toast with the same `id` is updated instead of stacking.
- When the loading fails, or `canvas_json` is not an object, it shows neither the canvas nor the buttons.
  It shows a message with `role="alert"` and a link to the list.
  This keeps auto-save from overwriting the content that could not be loaded.
